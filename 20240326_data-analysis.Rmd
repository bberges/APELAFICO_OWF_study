```

## Data set overview

```{r echo=FALSE} 
pander::pandoc.table(overview.tab,
                     style="simple", split.tables=200, justify="right", missing=".")

```

## Data curration

- Most WBAT data were recorded in 5 minute intervals, sequentially at 70 kHz and 200 kHz
- Some WBAT data sets had longer span (10-15 minutes)
- All data sets were standardized to intervals between 3.5 and 5 minutes by randomly sampling the full sampling interval
- SA are compiled as mean SA for each interval in a given hour
- CPOD data are sorted per hour, also with absence/presence

## Comparison of fish biomass - all combined

- More biomass at the "outside sites"
- Clear diurnal patterns with higher biomass at night
- Results are consistent at both 70 kHz and 200 kHz though the contrast between OWF and out is more pronounced at 70 kHz
- There is clear variations between sites

```{r echo=FALSE} 
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(figurePath,'WBAT_all_OWF vs out all_70khz.png')) 
```

```{r echo=FALSE} 
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(figurePath,'WBAT_all_OWF vs out all_200khz.png')) 
```
  
## Comparison of fish biomass - comparison per pairs

```{r echo=FALSE} 
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(figurePath,'WBAT_pairing_70khz.png')) 
```

```{r echo=FALSE} 
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(figurePath,'WBAT_pairing_200khz.png')) 
```

## HP presence and activity

- HP presence is higher at the control sites
- It is however the reverse for PPM which is higher for OWF sites

```{r echo=FALSE} 
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(figurePath,'CPOD_HP presence_all.png')) 
```

```{r echo=FALSE} 
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(figurePath,'CPOD_HP PPM_all.png')) 
```

## Fish biomass vs HP presence

- Surprisingly, results are inconsistent between 70 kHz and 200 kHz
- This needs to be investigated further

- @70kHz: HP presence is associated with higher biomass

```{r echo=FALSE} 
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(figurePath,'WBAT_HP presence_boxplot_70khz_all.png')) 
```

- @70kHz cont'd: the trend is fairly consistent between data sets

```{r echo=FALSE} 
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(figurePath,'WBAT_HP presence_boxplot_70khz.png')) 
```

- @200kHz: HP presence is associated with lower biomass

```{r echo=FALSE} 
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(figurePath,'WBAT_HP presence_boxplot_200khz_all.png')) 
```

- @200kHz cont'd: but... some sites examplify higher HP presence with higher biomass, especially at night.

```{r echo=FALSE} 
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(figurePath,'WBAT_HP presence_boxplot_200khz.png'))
```

## Fish biomass vs HP PPM

- Possible increase of PPM with higher biomass for both 70 kHz and 200 kHz. The increase is more pronouced at 200 kHz

```{r echo=FALSE} 
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(figurePath,'WBAT_HP pos minutes_boxplot_70khz_all.png'))
```

```{r echo=FALSE} 
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(figurePath,'WBAT_HP pos minutes_boxplot_200khz_all.png'))
```

- Plots by day/night

```{r echo=FALSE} 
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(figurePath,'WBAT_HP pos minutes_stats_70khz.png'))
```

```{r echo=FALSE} 
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(figurePath,'WBAT_HP pos minutes_stats_200khz.png'))
